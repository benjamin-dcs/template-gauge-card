> [!CAUTION]
> ### `Template Gauge Card` is now `Gauge Card Pro`
> `Template Gauge Card` has been renamed to `Gauge Card Pro` as the card is no longer just about _templates_ and to leave room for future features that are not template related.
>
> This release will be the last release under this repository/name. Please use `https://github.com/benjamin-dcs/gauge-card-pro` from now on. This release is already available under the new name. Changing to `Gauge Card Pro` requires a change in your card config from `type: custom:template-gauge-card` to `type: custom:gauge-card-pro`

# Template Gauge Card

### Build beautiful Gauge cards using 🛠️ templates and 🌈 gradients!

## Description

This card is based on the default [Gauge card](https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/gauge/), but the majority of the fields can, independently, be set with a (templatable) value. Additionally, it is possible to have a different `value` and `valueText` and a _beautiful_ 🌈
**gradient** can be applied!

## Examples

- [Energy Grid Neutrality Card](examples/energy-grid-neutrality-gauge.md)

## Installation

### HACS

Gauge Card Pro is not yet available in HACS. Soon a request to be accepted will be created. In the meantime, this repo can be added as [`custom repository`](https://www.hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories/).

Use `https://github.com/benjamin-dcs/gauge-card-pro` as **Repository** and `Dashboard` as **Type**

### Manual

1. Download `gauge-card-pro.js` file from the [latest release][release-url].
2. Put `gauge-card-pro.js` file into your `config/www` folder.
3. Add reference to `gauge-card-pro.js` in Dashboard. There's two way to do that:
   - **Using UI:** _Settings_ → _Dashboards_ → _More Options icon_ → _Resources_ → _Add Resource_ → Set _Url_ as `/local/gauge-card-pro.js` → Set _Resource type_ as `JavaScript Module`.
     **Note:** If you do not see the Resources menu, you will need to enable _Advanced Mode_ in your _User Profile_
   - **Using YAML:** Add following code to `lovelace` section.
     ```yaml
     resources:
       - url: /local/gauge-card-pro.js
         type: module
     ```
